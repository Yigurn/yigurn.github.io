        <p>Using string I marked out the location of the two E strings in order to place the pickup in the right locations and began routing the cavities. I recessed a smaller hole for the pickup to sit in while the screws rest in the edges.

Due to the design I was going for, I wanted to make the cavities as small as possible as there would be no pickguard covering them on either the front or the back of the guitar. Because of the shape of the pickups I would have to either extend the cavities out on one of the sides, or carve a hole within the side of each cavity. I attempted the latter, but due to not have the correct tools found this not to be possible and instead decided that I could file down the plastic of the pickups (Probably not the best idea, but I had a few laying around). Whilst trying to screw in the pickups I had 2 screws snap their heads and get stuck in the body, after a few attempts at removing the screws I started to damage the body and end up unfortunately leaving them in there.</p>
