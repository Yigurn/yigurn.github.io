<p>Using string I marked out the location of the two E strings in order to place the pickup in the right locations and began routing the cavities. I recessed a smaller hole for the pickup to sit in while the screws rest in the edges.</p>

<div class="flex">

</div>

<p>Due to the design I was going for, I wanted to make the cavities as small as possible as there would be no pickguard covering them on either the front or the back of the guitar. Because of the shape of the pickups I would have to either extend the cavities out on one of the sides, or carve a hole within the side of each cavity. I attempted the latter, but due to not have the correct tools found this not to be possible and instead decided that I could file down the plastic of the pickups (Probably not the best idea, but I had a few laying around).</p>

<p>Whilst trying to screw in the pickups I had 2 screws snap their heads and get stuck in the body, after a few attempts at removing the screws I started to damage the body and end up unfortunately leaving one in there.</p>

<p>I spent a while figuring out the best location for the cavities to join up, since I didn't want to use a pickguard on the guitar, the wires would have to travel through tunnels inside the body. This also helped me choose the best location for the jack socket and switches, since they would be the entry points for the drill.</p>
