<p>Dobble is a card game where you try to match the images between cards, but with a few challenges. Each of the 55 cards has 8 images out of a pool of over 50, but there is only ever one image in common between any two cards.</p>

<p>My girlfriend is an artist and had the idea of designing her own version with images based off of our time together. I decided to help out by designing a program to help create the cards by choosing images so that they follow the Dobble rules above and allowing for different amounts of images per card.</p>

  <img width="600" height="300" src="/images/posts/generator.PNG" alt="Cavities started" />

<p>This program takes in a folder where your images are contained, plus an optional background image and create the cards for you. A key is given on the right for the number of images needed depending on how many you want on each card. The images are rotated and scaled to fit.</p>

<p>If you would like to try out this program, it can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/Yigurn">Github</a>.</p>
