Dobble is a game where you try to match the images between cards, but with a few challenges. Each of the 55 cards has 8 images out of a pool of over 50, but there is only ever one image in common between any two cards.

My girlfriend is an artist and had the idea of designing her own Dobble game with images based off of our time together. I decided to help her out by designing a program to help create the cards by choosing images so that they follow the Dobble rules above.
