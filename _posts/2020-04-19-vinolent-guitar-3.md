<p>After drilling the holes for the wire paths, I needed to route out space for the socket. This had to be done precisely, otherwise I could carve too far into the guitar and hit the bridge screws.</p>

<p>It is at this point that I realized I had made a serious mistake with the neck. There was no zeroth fret...</p>

<p>We had somehow not seen this when doing our research, and so after discussions of cutting a new neck/ trying to add a nut back in/ or just using a capo and down tuning the guitar, I pried a fret from an old damaged guitar neck and placed it when the nut would have been.</p>

<p>After all these issues it was finally time to test out the guitar. I applied some test wiring to the guitar to make sure everything worked and strung up the guitar for the first time. It sounded... Bad. But there was sound, and I assumed the noise was due to the lack of shielding and all the exposed wires which weren't even properly soldered so we are not loosing hope yet!</p>

<p> The wiring for this guitar is the simplest of all that I have worked on so far, there are no tone or volume pots. All I have added are two switches on the side, one for each of the neck pickups to turn them on/off.
