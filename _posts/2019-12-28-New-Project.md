Whilst renovating Michael's kitchen, they ended up having excess wood from the countertop. Which he noticed was about the same thickness as a regular guitar body.
So after our previous attempts at modifying old guitars, we began discussing ideas for new designs.

Within a few day we had gathered the tools and parts we needed and began cutting out the shape of the body.
