<p>Whilst renovating Michael's kitchen, they ended up having excess wood from the countertop. Which he noticed was about the same thickness as a regular guitar body.
So after our previous attempts at modifying old guitars, we began discussing ideas for new designs.</p>

<p>This guitar had a broken neck which we replaced and completely changed the wiring to include: individual pickup selection and tone switches, overall volume controls at set steps rather than continuous.</p>

<p>Whilst trying to decide on pickup location we joked about placing them in the shape of the Vinolent face, and the idea was born. Since we were making the body as small as possible we also decided to make a headless guitar for an even smaller height.</p>

Within a few day we had gathered the tools and parts we needed and began cutting out the shape of the body.

<p>For the neck we had to cut it at the right point to allow it to fit snug against the fretboard, at first we tried on a neck that was already damaged to see how easy it would be to convert.</p>
