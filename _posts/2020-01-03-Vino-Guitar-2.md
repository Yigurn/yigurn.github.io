We finished carving out the body and attached the bridge as low as possible. Since we had to cut out the body from the front and back due to short drill bits, there was a lot of rough edges that needed sanding down.

Next we needed the neck to be the correct distance from the bridge and began routing the neck pocket. Since this needed to be much more accurate than the overall body shape we routed a smaller area and hand filed to the desired size.
At this point I had to go back to London again since the holidays were over.
