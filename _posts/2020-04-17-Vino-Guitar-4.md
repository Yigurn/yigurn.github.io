I spent a while figuring out the best location for the cavities to join up, since I didn't want to use a pickguard on the guitar. This also helped me choose the best location for the jack socket and switches, since they would be the entry points for the drill.
After I had the holes drilled, I needed to route out space for the socket. This had to be done precisely, otherwise I could carve too far into the guitar and hit the bridge screws.

It is at this point that I realized I had made a serious mistake with the neck. There was no zeroth fret...

We had somehow not seen this when doing our research, and so after discussions of trying to add a nut back in, or just using a capo and down tuning the guitar, I pried a fret from an old guitar neck and placed it when the nut would have been.

I applied some test wiring to the guitar to make sure everything worked and strung up the guitar for the first time. It sounded... Bad. But there was sound, and I assumed the noise was due to the lack of shielding and all the exposed wires which weren't even properly soldered.
