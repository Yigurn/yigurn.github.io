After playing my brothers new twin-stick game <a href="https://thenewtropic.itch.io/extreme-social-distancing">Extreme Social Distancing</a>, I was sitting at my drum kit and realized the idea could be used to make a challenging drum simulator where you have to move the sticks around as well as focus on playing in time.

I began creating a simple concept game to test how fun/challenging it is [Gif of 0.0.3]
