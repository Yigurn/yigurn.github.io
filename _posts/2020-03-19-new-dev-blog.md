Welcome to a new devblog about Endless Planet. Here I will record the progress made as the game develops. The idea is for Endless Planet to be a 4 player local co-op game, where you hop between different planets fighting with or against each other.
On from this post, I will try and make weekly posts with the new features and progress. If you want to follow along and see which features are being currently worked on, you can check out the trello page, or see a current gameplay video.
