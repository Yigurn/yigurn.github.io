<p>Over Christmas, a friend and I started designing a guitar based on the logo of our band. Our plan was for the pickups to fit in the slots for the eyes and mouth. In order to keep the shape as similar as we could, we decided on a small body as possible, extending the bottom to support the bridge.</p>

<p>Since we were making the body as small as possible we also decided to make a headless guitar for an even smaller height, so we had to cut off the head at the right point to allow the string locking component to fit snug against the fretboard. At first we tried on a neck that was already damaged to see how easy it would be to convert.</p>

<p>Within a few days we had gathered the tools and parts we needed to begin cutting out the shape of the body. We tried to keep the pickup placements as close to the original design whilst still being functional, so the bridge pickup is positioned under all six strings and the two neck pickups cover the low E and the highest two strings.</p>

</div>

<p>We finished carving out the body and attached the bridge as low as possible. Since we had to cut out the body from the front and the back, due to short drill bits, there was a lot of rough edges that needed sanding down. Next we needed the neck to be the correct distance from the bridge and began routing the neck pocket. Since this needed to be much more accurate than the overall body shape we routed a smaller area and hand filed to the desired size.</p>
