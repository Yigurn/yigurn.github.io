<p>After a few day of sanding the guitar, rounding the corners and filling in small holes it was in a stage where I was ready to paint it. A few coats later, the seems in the wood started to show through, which was a little worrying, but I persevered. I began the black outline, trying to get a slight fade effect around the edge.</p>

</div>

<p>The cavities are all filled with several coats of conductive paint, which looks and works great, apart from the fact that if you ever touch it, it will rub off straight away, I actually really like that this happened, because it gave the yellow a more uneven colour more like the band logo.</p>

<p>A few coats of Lacquer and some fine sanding was all that was needed to finish off the guitar, before assembling it all together ready to play.</p>

<p>Hopefully I will be back to give a post mortem about the sound and how well it is holding up. Now all that is left is to learn how to play!</p>
